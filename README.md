Stock Trading Automation Project
- Developed a trading bot that automates stock orders to ensure the earliest placement during high-demand periods, leveraging computational speed over manual input.
- Created a floorsheet analyzer that scrapes and extracts real-time data from the floorsheet page, analyzes it, and sends relevant insights via Telegram.
